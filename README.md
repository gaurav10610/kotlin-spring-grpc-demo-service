# Travel Booking Platform

## Overview

The Travel Booking Platform is a modern web application built using Kotlin and Spring Boot, with gRPC APIs for inter-service communication, MongoDB for data storage, and AWS SQS for asynchronous messaging. This platform allows users to search for and book flights, hotels, and car rentals seamlessly.

## High-Level Architecture

The Travel Booking Platform follows a microservices architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability. Key components of the architecture include:

### Backend Services

- **User Service**: Handles user authentication, registration, and profile management.
- **Booking Service**: Manages booking-related operations, such as creating, updating, and canceling bookings.
- **Search Service**: Provides search functionality for flights, hotels, and car rentals.
- **Flight Service**: Manages flight-related operations, including search and booking.
- **Hotel Service**: Manages hotel-related operations, including search and booking.
- **Car Rental Service**: Manages car rental-related operations, including search and booking.

### gRPC APIs

- Define gRPC APIs for communication between microservices.
- Facilitate fast and efficient communication using protocol buffers.

### MongoDB

- NoSQL database chosen for its flexibility and scalability.
- Stores user profiles, booking information, and other data related to travel options.
- Ensures efficient retrieval and storage of data required for various functionalities.

### AWS SQS

- Used for asynchronous messaging to decouple components and improve scalability.
- Publishes events for booking success or failure, enabling real-time updates and notifications.

### Authentication and Authorization

- JWT-based authentication mechanism used to secure endpoints and manage user sessions.
- Authorization rules enforced to control access to sensitive functionalities.

## Search and Booking Functionality

### Search Functionality

- Users can search for flights, hotels, and car rentals based on various criteria such as date, destination, and preferences.
- Search functionality implemented using dedicated search services for each travel option.
- Results displayed to users with relevant details and options for booking.

### Booking Functionality

- Users can book flights, hotels, and car rentals seamlessly through the platform.
- Dedicated booking services handle booking-related operations for each travel option.
- Booking service interacts with payment gateway for secure payment processing.
- Confirmation emails/messages sent to users upon successful bookings.

## Choice of NoSQL Database

### MongoDB

- Chosen for its flexibility, scalability, and ease of development.
- Allows storing complex data structures without predefined schemas, facilitating rapid development and iteration.
- Offers horizontal scalability, making it suitable for handling large volumes of data and concurrent requests in a distributed environment.
- Provides rich querying capabilities and supports indexing for efficient retrieval of user profiles and booking information.

### Storing and Retrieving User Profiles and Booking Information

- User profiles stored in MongoDB collections, containing information such as username, email, password (hashed), and preferences.
- Booking information stored in separate collections, structured to include details of bookings such as user ID, travel option ID, booking status, and timestamp.
- Utilize MongoDB's indexing capabilities to optimize queries for retrieving user profiles and booking information efficiently.
- Leverage MongoDB's aggregation framework for performing complex queries and analytics on booking data.

## Conclusion

The Travel Booking Platform leverages modern technologies and architectural patterns to provide a robust and scalable solution for booking travel options. With its microservices architecture, asynchronous messaging, and NoSQL database, the platform ensures high performance, real-time updates, and seamless user experience for travelers worldwide.
