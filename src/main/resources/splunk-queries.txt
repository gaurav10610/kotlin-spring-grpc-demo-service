query 4 => index=web_logs status=200 | stats count by clientip | where count > [ search index=web_logs status=404 | stats count ]

Explanation:
index=web_logs status=200: This part of the query searches for log events in the web_logs index where the HTTP status code is 200.

| stats count by clientip: This part of the query calculates the count of log events for each unique clientip (IP address) using the stats command.

| where count > [ subsearch ]: This is where the subsearch is used. The subsearch is enclosed within square brackets and is used to filter the results based on a condition derived from another search.

subsearch index=web_logs status=404 | stats count: This subsearch searches for log events in the web_logs index where the HTTP status code is 404 and then calculates the count of such events using the stats command.

The main search where count > [ subsearch ] filters the results from the main search (status=200) to only include clientip values where the count of status 200 is greater than the count of status 404 found in the subsearch.
